# ðŸ”§ frictionless2md
A tool to convert frictionless metadata (datapackage.yaml or json) to markdown file (that can be used as README).

> You can obtain a [markdown file like this](https://github.com/chiaraadornetto/dati-tv-elezioni-ue-2019#readme).

## Set-up
Download `script.sh` 
```bash
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dennisangemi/frictionless2md/main/script.sh"
```

make it executable
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

## Usage
Read [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) otherwise the bash script won't work.

Currently you can launch 
```bash
./script.sh
``` 
in a directory where a datapackage is located and the default output file will be `METADATA.md`.

### Options

**`-o` Set custom output filename**

If you want to use a custom output filename you can use `-o` flag:
```bash
./script.sh -o customfilename.md
```

**`-t` Add repository structure**

If you want to add the tree of the folder where your datapackage is located you can add the `-t` flag:
```bash
./script.sh -t
```

This option requires the `tree` utility.

**`-u` Add GitHub URLs to files**

You can add "- URL" to the bulleted list of the output (Data dictionary section) specifying the flag `-u` followed by your GitHub username and the repository name (`username/repo`):

```bash
./script.sh -u dennisangemi/frictionless2md
```


## Development
`script.sh` is a bash script
